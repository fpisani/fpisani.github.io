                                <p>Current prospects for the Internet of Things (IoT) indicate that, within the next few years, a global network of objects will connect tens of billions of devices through the Internet. Most of these devices will contain sensors to help them interact with the environment around them, and the data they collect will be a prime target for data analytics due to the expected pervasiveness of the IoT.</p>
								<p>When working with the data streams generated by sensors, it is common for users to need to transform the raw collected data into something else before storing the final values. For example, they may wish to standardize or clean the data (parsing), discard unwanted readings (filtering), or generate knowledge (predicting). Currently, the cloud is the usual place of choice for executing this type of task. However, with the ever-growing scale of the IoT, it will be necessary to re-evaluate this strategy, as transmitting the immense volume of information produced by IoT devices through the network will be too taxing.</p>
								<p>A possible way to meet these coming requirements is to not send every single byte to be processed by machines that are far from the data source but instead bring the computation closer to where the information already is. With this premise, was created what is called fog computing, a recent paradigm that proposes to process data closer to network edge devices, such as switches and routers.</p>
								<p>Another common characteristic among a large number of IoT devices will be the fact that their resources (e.g., power, memory, and processing) will be limited. The USA's National Institute of Standards and Technology calls attention to this type of device within the fog computing context, naming them mist nodes, as they are lightweight fog computing nodes.</p>
								<p>However, they characterize these nodes as more specialized, dedicated, and often sharing the same locality with the smart end-devices they service. In our work, we propose a different approach, where these constrained devices are integrated with sensors and are capable of general-purpose code execution, thus being able to run custom code sent by users. This way, mist nodes would not be simply nearby devices that can perform specific tasks to process sensor data, but instead, be devices that can be leveraged by users interested in analyzing the data they collect.</p>

                                <p>With the intent of investigating the viability of our proposal, we divided our analysis into two parts. First, we developed a platform called LMC which allows users to execute their code on constrained devices and compared it to the Apache Edgent framework. LMC performed well when executed on the same device as Edgent and also made it possible to execute the code on a constrained device, which was too limited to execute the other tool [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2017.10" target="_blank">1</a>]. Then, we created two models where the user chooses a certain cost metric (e.g., number of instructions, execution time, energy consumption) and employs it to decide where their code should be executed. One of them is a generic mathematical model that uses a linear equation to determine the costs and the other is a visual model that allows the user to easily conclude what is the most profitable approach in a specific scenario. We used these models to identify the situations where executing the code on the device that collected the data would be the chosen approach and also simulated future scenarios where changes in the technology can impact the user's decision [<a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/fi11020034" target="_blank">2</a>].</p>
